1. Incident commander name Hz.A

2. Executive summary of what happened
Three crypto mining pods named moneropool, minergate, and cryptonight were launched by an attacker. This resulted to a huge CPU utilization  and some abnormalities were detected.
An attacker was able to get control of the cluster and use compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.

3. Summary of what was affected
Unexpected spike in resource usage and the clusters were ran out of resources.
A huge spike in the CPU usage

4. Summary of the impact
The crypto-miner was consuming a huge amount of CPU and other resources as a result, the cluster is unable to serve the incoming traffic.
The attacker managed to run crypto miners on the system and spiked the CPU usage. This crashed the running pods due to the system's incapability of handling the CPU spike.
An attacker was able to get control of the cluster and use compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.Hence as a result, the cluster is unable to serve the incoming traffic.
The crypto-miner was consuming a huge amount of CPU thereby slowly bringing the system to a halt, and suspicious services running in the cluster fighting for system resource with legitimate services.


5. Summary of the remediation steps
Action  taken to remov a suspicious or unrecognized services within the cluster/node by using the following command:
kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force. Then the pods are removed. 

6. Summary of lessons learned
- It is good to have a monitoring tool setup like the Grafana dashboards to visualize what is happening in the
  system. It would be helpful to have alerts from Falco in Grafana for events like these.To use admission controllers
  to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods with monitoring
